Fingerprint Attendance with Control System (F.A.C.S)

Overview

The Fingerprint Attendance with Control System (F.A.C.S) is a biometric-based attendance tracking system designed for companies to accurately manage employee attendance both offline and online. It consists of a hardware fingerprint module integrated with a software application used by authorized administrators.

Key Features

* **Offline attendance support**: Attendance data is stored locally on the hardware when the software application is offline.
* **Data sync on reconnection**: Once the software application comes back online, the hardware automatically transmits all stored offline data for proper logging and synchronization.
* **Admin controls**: Administrators can manage attendance data, register and remove employees, and add or remove other system admins.
* **Manual override**: Admins have the ability to manually time-out employees who may have left the premises without properly checking out.

How the System Works

For Registered Employees

When an employee places their finger on the fingerprint sensor:

* The system scans the fingerprint and matches it against the local database.
* If a match is found and the employee has not timed in, the system records a **time-in** and sends this data to the software application.
* If the employee is already timed in for the day, placing their finger again will record a **time-out**, and the data will be forwarded to the software application.

For Unregistered Users

If someone not registered in the system attempts to use the fingerprint sensor:

* The system checks the fingerprint against its database.
* If no match is found, the system rejects the attempt, ensuring that only registered employees can interact with the system.

Admin Software Application Features

Admins can:

* View attendance records, including time-ins, time-outs, late arrivals, and absences.
* Register new employees and initiate fingerprint enrollment (requires the employee to scan their finger twice).
* Remove employee data when individuals resign or are terminated.
* Add new admin users.
* Remove admin access for users no longer authorized.

Admin Software Usage

* Admins log in using secure, registered credentials to access the control panel.
* Upon adding a new employee, the software prompts the hardware module to begin fingerprint enrollment.
* Employee fingerprints are captured and stored securely by placing their finger twice on the sensor.
* Admins may remove employee records from the system as needed.
